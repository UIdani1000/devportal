You can try out the RSK CLI in an online sandbox environment like Replit without needing to set up everything locally. Follow these steps to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Account with Replit">

    Ensure you have a [Replit](https://replit.com/) account. If you don’t already have one, you can sign up for free.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Access the Project">
  
   To access the RSK CLI project, visit the following link: **[Rootstock-CLI on Replit](https://replit.com/@rootstockDevX/Rootstock-CLI#README.md)**.

  </figure>

    This project provides a convenient interface for interacting with the Rootstock blockchain, enabling tasks such as wallet management, balance checking, `RBTC` transfers, and smart contract deployment. 
    
    The Replit environment allows you to run the CLI directly in your browser without requiring any local setup, making it accessible and easy to use.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Fork the Project">
   
    Click on the **Fork** button at the top right of the page to create a copy of the project under your Replit account. 
    > This step allows you to make changes and test the CLI without affecting the original project.

  </Step>
  <Step title=" Run the Project">

      <figcaption>Run Rootstock CLI on Replit (fig 2.)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
     Once the project is forked, you’ll see the code editor and the options for running the project.  
    * Click the **Run** button at the top of the page. This will start the CLI and open it in a console window on the right-hand side of the screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interact with the CLI">

     You should see the CLI interface running in the Replit terminal. Here you can use the CLI commands to test various functionalities like creating a wallet, switching wallets, and executing `read/write` functions.
  </Step>
 </Steps>
