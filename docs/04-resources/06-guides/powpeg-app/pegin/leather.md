## Using Leather Software wallet to perform a peg-in

In this guide, we will be using the [PowPeg App](https://powpeg.rootstock.io/) for unlocking Leather, access peg-in to use Leather, and verify if peg-in is active.

### Acessing pegin to use Leather

![leather-pegin](/img/resources/powpeg/choose-your-wallet.png)

After click on **Leather** button, you will see the pegin Leather page, then the PowPeg will connect with your Leather wallet.

> NOTE: To know how to install the Leather chrome plugin, go to [Leather Page](https://leather.io/).

### Unlocking Leather

Unlock Leather using the same password that you created in the installation.

**Step 1: Creatting a transaction**

**Enter Amount**

The next step is to enter an amount you would like to send. The amount entered appears in the BTC field, and you can see the corresponding amount in USD under transaction summary.

![Enter Amount](/img/resources/powpeg/enter-amount.png)

> - The minimum amount to send to perform a pegin operation is **0.005 BTC**, any amount less than this throws an error message: **“You cannot send that amount of BTC, you can only send a minimum of 0.005 BTC”**.
> - The minimum amount to send to perform a pegout operation is **0.004 RBTC**, any amount less than this throws an error message: **“You cannot send that amount of BTC, you can only send a minimum of 0.005 BTC”**.
> - The maximum amount to send to perform a pegout or pegout operation is **10 RBTC / BTC**, any amount greater than this throws an error message: **“The maximum accepted value is 10”**.

> - Note that the amount sent in BTC is the same amount to be received in RBTC on the Rootstock network.

**Step 2: Enter address**

To enter an address, we are provided with two options: 

- (1) Your connected Rootstock address. See [Account based addresses](/concepts/account-based-addresses/) 
- (2) Connect to a software wallet. E.g, Metamask. Here, the address is automatically filled in by the account that is connected to your metamask wallet.

**Step 3: Add a custom address**

Also you can input a custom Rootstock address, different than the connected address.

**Step 4: Select Transaction Fee**

Here, we can select the fee that will be used for this transaction, this is set on default to average.

**Step 5: View transaction summary**

In this section, we can confirm the selected values:

- Destination Address
- Estimated time
- BTC fee (Network fee)
- Provider fee (always zero for this option)
- Amount to send
- Value to receive

![Review Transaction](/img/resources/powpeg/ledger-pegin-review-details.png)

> - In the instance of an error on this transaction, the amount will be sent to the address indicated in the **refund Bitcoin address** located in your hardware wallet.
> - See the [glossary](/resources/guides/powpeg-app/glossary/) section for the meaning of these values.

**Step 6: Confirm the Transaction**

![leather-verify](/img/resources/powpeg/confirm-leather-pegin-tx.png)

 **Step 7: View transaction status**

This shows the status of your transaction, with a transaction ID and a link to check the transaction on the explorer. 

![view transaction status](/img/resources/powpeg/ledger-pegin-tx-finished.png)

By clicking on the **See Transaction** button, the user can check the status directly in the transaction status page, by clicking in **Start Again** button the user can perform another transaction.

See the [Viewing Peg-in Transaction Status](/resources/guides/powpeg-app/pegin/status) section for more information. 

**Now you have successfully performed a peg-in transaction using the PowPeg App.**
